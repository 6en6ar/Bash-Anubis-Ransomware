# Bash-Anubis-Ransomware
A simple linux ransomware script using Bash
This is a simple linux ransomware that uses linux binaries such as openssl and shred to encrypt the filesystem
Use with caution. To test the script make a TestFolder where you will have the files you want to encrypt. Do not try this on a system you do not own !!
Please use this for educational puproses only. You are responsible for your own actions. This is a project I made strictly to learn more about ransomware.
